INTRODUCTION
------------

Here are a handful of dotfiles set up to my taste.

INSTALLATION
------------

First, clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/enocom/dotfiles.git
```

After navigating to the repo's root directory, link the `bash_profile` and `aliases` with the handy `install.sh` script.

```
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```
